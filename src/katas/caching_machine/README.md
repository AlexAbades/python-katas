## Optimizing through memoization

**Optimize the recursive Fibonacci function** by implementing **manual caching (memoization)** to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.  

Hereâ€™s the revised exercise statement:  

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:  
```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

A naive recursive implementation directly follows this definition but is highly inefficient because it recalculates values multiple times.  

## Bonus

Implement a memoization system for functions of 1 paramenter.
